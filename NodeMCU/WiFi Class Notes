The WiFi class initializes the ethernet library and network settings.

1- WiFi.begin(ssid,password) : Initializes the WiFi library's network settings and provides the current status.
WiFi.begin(ssid,KeyIndex,Key) : WEP encrypted networks can hold upto 4 different keys. This identifies which key you are going to use.
Key is the hexadecimal string used as a security code for WEP encrypted networks.

- WL_CONNECTED = when connected to a network.
- WL_IDLE_STATUS = when not connected to a network but powered on.
These are the returns

2- WiFi.disconnect() : Disconnects the WiFi shield from the current network.

3- WiFi.SSID() : Gets the SSID of the current network. Returns the SSID the WiFi shield is currently connected to.

4- WiFi.scanNetworks() : Scans for available WiFi networks and returns the discovered number. Returns number of discovered networks
(byte)

5- WiFi.status() : Return the connection status.
Returns -

    WL_CONNECTED: assigned when connected to a WiFi network;
    WL_NO_SHIELD: assigned when no WiFi shield is present;
    WL_IDLE_STATUS: it is a temporary status assigned when WiFi.begin() is called and remains active until the number of attempts expires (resulting in WL_CONNECT_FAILED) or a connection is established (resulting in WL_CONNECTED);
    WL_NO_SSID_AVAIL: assigned when no SSID are available;
    WL_SCAN_COMPLETED: assigned when the scan networks is completed;
    WL_CONNECT_FAILED: assigned when the connection fails for all the attempts;
    WL_CONNECTION_LOST: assigned when the connection is lost;
    WL_DISCONNECTED: assigned when disconnected from a network; 
    
6- WiFi.macAddress(mac) : Gets the MAC Address of your WiFi shield. mac is a 6 byte array to hold the MAC Address. Returns 6 bytes
representing MAC Address of the shield.

7- WiFi.BSSID(bssid) : Gets the MAC Address of the router you are connected to. bssid is 6 byte array. 

8- WiFi.RSSI(wifiAccessPoint) : Gets the signal strength of the connection to the router. wifiAccessPoint specifies from which
network to get the info. Returns "long" RSSSI or Received Signal Strenght in dBm.

9- WiFi.encryptionType(wifiAccessPoint) : Gets the encryption type of the current network. wifiAccessPoint specifies which network to get 
information from.
Return - 

byte : value represents the type of encryption.

    TKIP (WPA) = 2
    WEP = 5
    CCMP (WPA) = 4
    NONE = 7
    AUTO = 8 

10- WiFi.getSocket() : gets the first socket available. Returns int : the first socket available
