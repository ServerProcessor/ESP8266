1- ESP8266EX offers a complete and self-contained WiFi networking solution.
2- When ESP8266EX hosts the application, it boots up directly from an external flash.
3- It has integrated cache to  improve the performance of the system in such applications.
4- It integrates the antenna switches, RF balun, power amplifier, low noise receive amplifier,filters, power management modules, it
requires minimal external circuitry, and the entire solution, including front-end module, is designed to occupy minimal PCB area.
5- ESP8266EX also integrates an enhanced version of Tensilicaâ€™s L106 Diamond series 32bit processorwith on-chip SRAM, besides the
WiFi functionalities. 
6- Integrated 10-bit ADC.
7- Integrated low power 32-bit MCU.
8- Integrated TCP/IP protocol stack.
9- 2.4GHz.
10- Network Protocols : IPv4, TCP/UDP/HTTP/FTP.
11- Flash Quad IO uses 4 lines for data for up to 4 times the speed of standard and Flash Dual IO uses 2 lines for data.
12- 3.3V output pins.
